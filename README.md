# HtmlCrudWebApi
Originally a demo of HTML Crud using WebAPI - from Code magazine Jan-Feb 2016

Now advanced to using Angular and WebAPI - from Code magazine Nov-Dec 2016

Build a Single Page Application (SPA) with ASP.NET Web API and Angular.js

# How to use it
Run it from within Visual Studio. Default page should be Angular.html


#Database
Entity Framework will create a LocalDb database if one doesn't already exist. 

It will be seeded with default products


#AngularJs Code
The app is contained in a module, and there is a custom directive for looking for string values in a URL field.

$scope and $http are required to work.
